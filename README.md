# Pricing-american-options-with-the-Longstaff-Schwartz-algorithm

The objective of this project is to price bermudan options using the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm. The continuation values are estimated through polynomial regression.

A lower bound for the option price is computed using a second simulation of independent trajectories, applying the optimal exercise strategy obtained from a previous set of simulated paths.

A upper bound for the option price is estimated using the Broadie-Andersen algorithm.
